        "abstract": "Cybersecurity has become a key factor that determines the success or failure of companies that rely on information systems. Therefore, investment in cybersecurity is an important financial and operational decision. Typical information technology investments aim to create value, whereas cybersecurity investments aim to minimize loss incurred by cyber attacks. Admittedly, cybersecurity investment has become an increasingly complex one, since information systems are typically subject to frequent attacks, whose arrival and impact fluctuate stochastically. Furthermore, cybersecurity measures and improvements, such as patches, become available at random points in time making investment decisions even more challenging. We propose and develop an analytical real options framework that incorporates major components relevant to cybersecurity practice, and analyze how optimal cybersecurity investment decisions perform for a private firm. The novelty of this paper is that it provides analytical solutions that lend themselves to intuitive interpretations regarding the effect of timing and cybersecurity risk on investment behavior using real options theory. Such aspects are frequently not implemented within economic models that support policy initiatives. However, if these are not properly understood, security controls will not be properly set resulting in a dynamic inefficiency reflected in cycles of over or under investment, and, in turn, increased cybersecurity risk following corrective policy actions. Results indicate that greater uncertainty over the cost of cybersecurity attacks raises the value of an embedded option to invest in cybersecurity. This increases the incentive to suspend operations temporarily in order to install a cybersecurity patch that will make the firm more resilient to cybersecurity breaches. Similarly, greater likelihood associated with the availability of a cybersecurity patch increases the value of the option to invest in cybersecurity. However, the absence of an embedded investment option increases the incentive to delay the permanent abandonment of the company's operation due to the irreversible nature of the decision.",

        "abstract": "When undertaking cybersecurity risk assessments, it is important to be able to assign numeric values to metrics to compute the final expected loss that represents the risk that an organization is exposed to due to cyber threats. Even if risk assessment is motivated by real-world observations and data, there is always a high chance of assigning inaccurate values due to different uncertainties involved (e.g., evolving threat landscape, human errors) and the natural difficulty of quantifying risk. Existing models empower organizations to compute optimal cybersecurity strategies given their financial constraints, i.e., available cybersecurity budget. Further, a general game-theoretic model with uncertain payoffs (probability-distribution-valued payoffs) shows that such uncertainty can be incorporated in the game-theoretic model by allowing payoffs to be random. This paper extends previous work in the field to tackle uncertainties in risk assessment that affect cybersecurity investments. The findings from simulated examples indicate that although uncertainties in cybersecurity risk assessment lead, on average, to different cybersecurity strategies, they do not play a significant role in the final expected loss of the organization when utilising a game-theoretic model and methodology to derive these strategies. The model determines robust defending strategies even when knowledge regarding risk assessment values is not accurate. As a result, it is possible to show that the cybersecurity investments\u2019 tool is capable of providing effective decision support.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to help companies address the problem of ever-increasing cybersecurity investment that does not produce tangible business value \u2013 this is achieved by explaining the relationship between cybersecurity and competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach: The impact of cybersecurity on competitive advantage was explored through a qualitative research study \u2013 the authors conducted an extensive literature review and conducted two rounds of semi-structured interviews with executives and security professionals from companies in four countries, from the financial, IT and security industries. Findings: The analysis of the findings enabled the conceptualization of the Cybersecurity Competitive Advantage Model that explains how to build up cybersecurity dynamic capabilities to achieve long-term competitive advantage. Research limitations/implications: The research presents the theorization of the model based on an extensive literature review, gathered information, insight from qualified respondents and the authors\u2019 experience in the field. While we controlled for saturation and rigorously collected and analyzed the data, the inductive approach followed may limit the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: The proposed model helps explain to executives how to differentiate their company in a novel way and how to retain that competitive advantage; security professionals can use the model to organize cybersecurity and communicate to their superiors more effectively. Originality/value: The presented model differs from existing literature, cybersecurity frameworks and industry standards by presenting a method of avoiding technological bias and for achieving competitive advantage.",

        "abstract": "As recent cyber-attacks have been increasing exponentially, the importance of security training for employees also has become growing ever than before. In addition, it is suggested that security training and education be an effective method for discerning cyber-attacks within academia and industries. Despite the importance and the necessity of the training, prior study did not investigate the quantitative utility of security training in an organizational level. Due to the absence of referential studies, many firms are having troubles in making decisions with respect to arranging optimal security training programs with limited security budgets. The main objective of this study is to find out a relationship between cybersecurity training and the number of incidents of organizations. Thus, this study quantified the effectiveness of security training on security incidents as the first study. This research examined the relationship among three main factors; education time, education participants, and outsourcing with numbers of cybersecurity incidents. 7089 firm level data is analyzed through Poisson regression method. Based on analysis results, we found that the negative relationship between security trainings and the occurrence of cybersecurity incidents. This study sheds light on the role of security training and education by suggesting its positive association with reducing the number of incidents in organizations from the quantitative perspective. The result of this study can be used as a referential guide for information security training decision-making procedure in organizations.",

        "abstract": "As federal agencies and businesses rely more on cyber infrastructure, they are increasingly vulnerable to cyber attacks that can cause damages disproportionate to the sophistication and cost to launch the attack. In response, regulatory authorities call for focusing attention on enhancing infrastructure resilience. For example, in the USA, President Obama issued an Executive Order and policy directives focusing on improving the resilience and security of cyber infrastructure to a wide range of cyber threats. Despite the national and international importance, resilience metrics to inform management decisions are still in the early stages of development. We apply the resilience matrix framework developed by Linkov et al. (Environ Sci Technol 47:10108-10110, 2013) to develop and organize effective resilience metrics for cyber systems. These metrics link national policy goals to specific system measures, such that resource allocation decisions can be translated into actionable interventions and investments. In this paper, a number of metrics have been identified and assessed using quantitative and qualitative measures found in the literature. We have proposed a generic approach and could integrate actual data, technical judgment, and literature-based measures to assess system resilience across physical, information, cognitive, and social domains. \u00a9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).",

        "abstract": "We study the decision-making problem in cybersecurity risk planning concerning resource allocation strategies by government and firms. Aiming to minimize the social costs incurred due to cyberattacks, we consider not only the monetary investment costs but also the deprivation costs due to detection and containment delays. We also consider the effect of positive externalities of the overall cybersecurity investment on an individual firm's resource allocation attitude. The optimal decision guides the firms on the countermeasure portfolio mix (detection vs. prevention vs. containment) and government intelligence investments while accounting for actions of a strategic attacker and firm budgetary limitations. We accomplish this via a two-stage stochastic programming model. In the first stage, firms decide on prevention and detection investments aided by government intelligence investments that improve detection effectiveness. In the second stage, once the attacker's actions are realized, firms decide on containment investments after evaluating the cyberattacks. We demonstrate the applicability of our model via a case study. We find that externality can reduce the government's intelligence investment and that the firm's detection investment receives priority over containment. We also note that while prevention effectiveness has a decreasing impact on intelligence, it is beneficial to spend more on intelligence given its increasing returns to the reduction of social costs related to cybersecurity.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a mixed integer linear programming formulation for optimisation of cybersecurity investment in Industry 4.0 supply chains. Using a recursive linearisation procedure, a complex nonlinear stochastic combinatorial optimisation model with a classical exponential function of breach probability is transformed into its linear equivalent. The obtained linear optimisation model is capable of selecting optimal portfolio of security safeguards to minimise cybersecurity investment and expected cost of losses from security breaches in a supply chain. The new efficiency measures of cybersecurity investment are introduced: cybersecurity value and cybersecurity ratio. In addition, the proposed linear model has been enhanced for the Hurwicz-type, best\u2013worst criterion to minimise a convex combination of the minimal and the maximal supply chain node vulnerability, under limited budget. The resulting compromise cybersecurity investment aims at balancing vulnerability over the entire supply chain, independent of cyberattack probabilities and potential losses by security breaches, thereby hardening the weaker critical nodes. The findings indicate a crucial role of intrinsic vulnerability, determined by the architecture of Industry 4.0 supply chain, and highlight \u2018design for cybersecurity\u2019 as an important emerging area of research.",

Cyberspace security measurement is an important step to protect any network. The important premise is to establish a reasonable and universal security measurement framework for network systems. But the network is very complex, and the network security state is changing all the time. Existing information security models lack the description of network behavior. Aiming at this problem, in this paper, the existing information security models at home and abroad are compared and analysed, and their advantages and disadvantages are summarized. Based on PDR (Protection, Detection, Response) model, this paper adds management functions, and optimizes the original concept of PDR model. On this basis, we add characteristic measurement, efficiency measurement and impact measurement to form 12 indicators to dynamically reveal the evolution mechanism of security characteristics measurement indicators. AHP is used to distribute the weight of each dimension, and the network is evaluated quantitatively from four dimensions: detection, protection, response and management. The framework of the proposed metric framework is verified by experiments.",
